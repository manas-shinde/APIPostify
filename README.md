# APIPOSTIFY

Welcome to the README file for our React app. This document will guide you through the process of running the app locally and provide explanations for some important concepts used in the project.

## Running the React App

To run the React app locally, please follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

4. The React app should now be running on http://localhost:3000. Open your web browser and navigate to this address to view the app.

## Concepts Explained

### 1) Use Axios for API Calls

This project utilizes Axios, a popular JavaScript library, for making API calls. Axios provides a simple and efficient way to send HTTP requests from the browser. In our app, we use Axios to communicate with the server and retrieve data asynchronously. You can find examples of API calls using Axios in our codebase.

### 2) Axios Interceptors

Axios interceptors are functions that allow us to intercept requests or responses before they are handled by our application. We can use interceptors to add headers, modify request/response data, handle errors, and more. In our app, we make use of Axios interceptors to handle authentication, error handling, and other global request/response modifications. You can explore the axios.interceptors section in our codebase to see how we configure and use interceptors.

### 3) Toaster in React

Toasters are used to display short-lived notifications or messages to users. In our React app, we utilize a toaster component to show notifications for various actions, such as successful API responses, errors, or important updates. The toaster component provides a non-intrusive way to communicate important information to users. You can find the implementation and usage of the toaster component in our codebase.

### 4) Optimistic Update

Optimistic update is a technique used to provide a smoother user experience by immediately updating the UI with an expected outcome of an action, even before the action is confirmed by the server. In our app, we implement optimistic updates when performing actions that modify data on the server. This approach helps to reduce perceived latency and provides instant feedback to the user. You can examine the code related to optimistic updates in the relevant sections of our project.

Feel free to explore the codebase and familiarize yourself with the implementation of these concepts. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy coding!
